- Greg and Oneil are playing around with machine learning and object recognition.
- The plan right now is to make a 'Bugs Bunney' detector. 
- If successful, we can expand it to multiple classes like 'Daffy Duck' and so forth.
- The goal is to learn how to create data sets for various machine vision applications.
